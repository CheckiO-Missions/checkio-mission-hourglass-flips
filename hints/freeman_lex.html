            Catch an idea 💡! The base cases of recursion are when <b>t</b> equals 0 or when exactly <b>t</b> minutes remain in some upper chamber (no flips are needed), or when <b>t</b> is smaller than the smallest time remaining in the upper chamber of any hourglass (no solution is possible). Otherwise, update all hourglasses to their new states after <b>m</b> minutes, and loop through all possible subsets of <b>glasses</b> to flip. For each such subset, recursively construct the optimal sequence of moves to measure the remaining <b>t - m</b> minutes, and combine these moves to the best solution.
